The Hydrate-inator is a drink serving robot that was used in my 
wedding. The project was put together by myself (Evan Palmer) and 
Charles Dawson, with help from Noel Palmer, Yanhao Yang, and Lydia 
Sylla. The Hydrate-inator successfully served over 150 guests (ages 
10-80 years old) ~15 gallons of water.
